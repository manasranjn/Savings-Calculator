# Saving Calculator

**Savings Goal Tracker** is an interactive app designed to help users plan and track their savings for a specific goal, like buying a car. With an input field for setting a target amount, users can update their current savings and specify monthly contributions. The app calculates the time required to reach the goal based on the input. For instance, if a user sets a $9,000 goal with only $100 saved and a $100 monthly contribution, the app calculates the estimated time to reach the target and displays motivational messages like “Keep nurturing your savings” until the goal is met.

If contributions are increased, such as contributing the entire target amount, the app dynamically adjusts and congratulates the user on reaching the goal in just one month. Similarly, if the user has substantial initial savings (e.g., $5,000) and a higher monthly contribution, the app celebrates the achievement with a message like “Congratulations, your savings have bloomed to reach your goal.” Additionally, a progress bar visually tracks and fills according to the savings progress toward the target, giving users a clear and engaging way to monitor their goal.

This app makes goal-setting motivational by providing positive feedback and a visual representation of progress, making it a practical and enjoyable tool for managing savings.
